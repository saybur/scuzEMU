 * The philosophy of this project is to work with anything implementing the toolbox,
 * so this "check" is mostly to verify we're speaking roughly the same language as the
 * device is expecting. If it doesn't appear to be an emulator this will ask the user
 * if they want to continue, remembering the result to avoid pestering them on
 * subsequent connections.
 *
 * As of July 2024 this check is mostly pointless, the only toolbox API is v0, but in
 * future releases there will likely be a need to get/set a version to communicate
 * properly.
 *
 * @param scsi  SCSI ID to check against, between 0-6.
 * @return      true if connecting should continue, false otherwise.
